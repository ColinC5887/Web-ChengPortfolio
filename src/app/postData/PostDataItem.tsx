      "## Game Description:\nThis project is for a game jam with the theme `tower`, set in a unique world above the clouds.\n\nThe story takes place in a massive tower or lighthouse where people live far above the surface. They are surrounded by fog, uncertainty, and the memory of a past catastrophe. You play as a young person who is tasked with daily chores in a fragile, vertical community that is struggling with water and food shortages.\n\n\n## Soundtrack in the Game\nTwo tracks were composed for this game. The goal was to support a calm, reflective atmosphere while carrying the emotional weight of the communityâ€™s uncertain future.\n\n\n### 01. The Cloudwalk\nThis is the main in-game theme, played during daytime exploration and task completion.\n\n* Style: Calm, quiet, monochromatic\n* Instruments: felt piano, warm strings, ambient textures\n* Emotion: peace, routine, and melancholy\n\nThe track reflects the weight of everyday life above the clouds. It maintains a sense of stillness while allowing the player to feel quietly immersed in the world.\n\n\n### 02. The Descent\nThis is the emotional theme triggered during the council meeting and late-game decisions.\n\n* Style: tense\n* Instruments: felt piano, strings, layered pads\n* Emotion: loss, reflection, fragile hope\n\nWhile `The Cloudwalk` represents daily survival, `The Descent` brings the emotional climax as the community questions whether it's time to return to the world below.\n\n\n## Music Files\nHere are the tracks:\n\n* [01.

The music is characterized by heavy drum patterns, sharp rhythms, and a consistent sense of momentum. Each piece is designed to support fast-paced gameplay, featuring minimal harmonic changes and focusing on groove, pacing, and loopability instead.\n\nThe soundtrack emphasizes energy over complexity, favoring tight percussion, pulsing synths, and a sense of forward motion that reflects the game's one-hit-kill mechanics and rapid progression through enemy encounters.\n\n\n## Music Files\nHere are the tracks:\n\n* [01.

The more enemies killed without getting hurt, the better stats of the player is.\n\n\n## Soundtrack in the Game\nThere are 3 tracks in the game and the logic is simple:\n\n* Based on the killing combo the background music changes.\n* In the beginning the game is under `Level 1` music, with a calm and warm vibe.\n* With some killing combo accumulate, the music fades into `Level 2` track. It's more upbeat and more energetic.\n* After some flawless and epic combat, the player reaches the highest killing combo and the background music is player `Level 3` instead. This time, it's very joyful, bright and shiny.\n\n\n## Music Files\nHere are the tracks:\n\n* [01. Level 1](/Post010/Level_1.mp3)\n* [02. Level 2](/Post010/Level_2.mp3)\n* [03.

I tried some orchestration instruments, but they can't make this high level of intensity. Leads and pads are the only choice.\n* Some toms are used in the drum kit to give the music a round feeling.\n* I tried to add the second melody line. But it will weaken the overall intensity. Fine, will add it in \"Level 2\" instead.\n\n**Level 2**\n\n* When Level 3 is complete, copy the project file and work on Level 2.\n* Replace leads with piano and change pads to strings.\n* Drums are reprogrammed. With less beats and energy.\n* Without the synths in the music, I could add a second melody line. It comes with violin and cello. My first choice was violin and trumpet, but I think it was too bright and hard to go with the piano.\n\n**Level 1**\n\n* This is the last track I made and the weakest of the three.\n* A lot of the instruments are taken from the music, it's much softer and weaker.\n* However, it's still a BGM for a dungeon crawler game with a killing combo feature. It can't be too weak. It took me a while to balance the mood.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nBecause I make music just for fun.

Starting from level 1 and finally reaching level 4.\n* Logically, the entire climbing area is divided into 4 sections, when the player reaches the last unlocked section, they are teleported back to the beginning and a new section is unlocked. The gameplay repeats until the player finishes section 4.\n* There are 4 tracks for each of the sections. When the player enters a new section, the track is played in the background.\n* Since the player can reach the next section at any time, the 4 tracks share the tempo, melody and harmony.\n\n\n## Soundtrack in Composing\n**Section 1**\n\n* This is for the first section on this world. This should also be the lowest track of the 4.\n* There are no broken chords in this track. All layers are removed, trying to keep the sound clean and simple.\n* This is based on the Section 2 track. Or, this is made after the Section 2 track.\n\n**Section 2**\n\n* This is the first track made during the jam.\n* Use of woodwinds to create a fantasy and warm vibe. Some pads added in the background to make it sound better.\n* Drums are too much for this section, a plucked bass is used to add some rhythm.\n\n**Section 3**\n\n* Building on `Section 2`, woodwinds are replaced by strings while harp is changed to piano.\n* Drums are introduced to add some power and strength.\n* I tried to make it bass-heavy, but it doesn't work with this game.\n\n**Section 4**\n\n* This is the last track.

      '## Game Description\n\nIn the world of Cruqujan, several floating islands drift in the sky, forming this mysterious and beautiful realm. On these islands, humans and dragons coexist harmoniously, leading relatively peaceful and tranquil lives. However, the sky suddenly turned crimson, and an ominous atmosphere enveloped the land, sending shivers down one\'s spine.\n\nFaced with this sudden upheaval, the protagonist and a white dragon decide to join forces and embark on a journey to uncover the truth behind this mysterious event. They will traverse the floating islands, encountering various dangers and challenges, searching for clues and unraveling the secrets hidden behind the scenes.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nIt\'s a 3D, low-poly, open-world, third-person view game. Similar to "World of Warcraft".\n\nThe gameplay is to explore several islands, find the secret, solve the puzzle and collect 5 "Ancient Ruins" to rebalance the world. It\'s not a hardcore game, but a relaxing "find the item" game. The gameplay is more about visiting each of the islands, talking to the villagers and finding the Ancient Ruins accordingly.\n\nThere is also a time system. The "Day" and "Night" periods will only last for 5 minutes of real time. Some of the "Ancient Ruins" are only available at certain times. This makes the game more playable.\n\n## Soundtrack in game\n\nThere are 6 tracks in the game:\n\n1. Floating Villages: For the village. Played when the player arrives at the starting village or other villages on another island.\n2. Wings of Radiance: Played during the day when the player is flying the white dragon.\n3. Daylight Islands: Play during daytime, but only when the player is on the island.\n4. Silver Wings in the Moonlight: Play at night when player is flying the white dragon.\n5. Whispering Drift: Plays at night, but only when the player is on the island.\n6. Cheers of Triumph: Track for the final cutscene. The player returns to the original village.\n\nThe `Wings of Radiance` track is a variation of the `Daylight Islands` track. The melody is taken from the music and remixed a bit. These tracks share the tempo and length of each section. In the game, when the player "lands" on an island, the music may seamlessly transition from the "flying" track to the "landed" track. That\'s by design. The same goes for `Silver Wings` and `Whispering Drift`.\n\n## Soundtrack in composing\n\nFloating Villages\n\n- I try to make it a fantasy village music. Two woodwinds and a harp are used to create the overall feeling.\n- Some reverb is added to the harp to give it a little fantasy feeling.\n\nWings of Radiance\n\n- Try to create a warm and calm feeling. That\'s the main feeling of the game.\n- Use piano and strings to build up the whole melody.\n- I added some drums. But I think it needs a relaxing and calm atmosphere. Since there\'s no fighting in the game, I shouldn\'t make it upbeat.\n\nDaylight Islands\n\n- Melody taken from the `Wings of Radiance` track.\n- Just a remix, improving the low end to make it feel more solid.\n\nSilver Wings in the Moonlight\n\n- In contrast to the bright daytime track, the atmosphere should be serene and calm. I try to achieve this by composing the melody with the piano.\n- And to make it more interesting, a cello plays a bass line.\n- A pad is added to enhance the high-end. It will make the music calm.\n\nWhispering Drift\n\n- Both the piano and the cello are muted.\n- A remix is done to keep the tonal balance.\n- This is just a variation of Silver Wings in the Moonlight. To give the player\'s ears a little time to relax. There is nothing interesting in this piece to be honest.\n\nCheers of Triumph\n\n- The last track. To match the end-game cutscene, it should be cheerful.\n- A set of broken chords is used to increase the happiness. And a pulse bass is used underneath to add some power.\n\n## Copyright\n\nBecause I make music just for fun.

      "## What Are These For\nThese tracks are for the [GGJ 2023](https://globalgamejam.org/). The theme is `ROOTS`.\n\nMy team has made a 2D puzzle game for it. It's about a girl who is tired of her current life. She tries to find happiness in her hometown.\n\n## About The Game And The Tracks\nThere are three chapters in the game:\n\n* Chapter 1: The girl is happy and carefree in her childhood.\n* Chapter 2: She wakes up and realizes that her happy life is just a dream. She feels disappointed.\n* Chapter 2: She travels back to her hometown (or, in other words, the 'root') to find her happiness.\n\nSo, there are three tracks in the game, one for each:\n\n* `Dream Of The Past`: Based on the design, it should be a calm and warm sound. Just to show the young lady's happiness.\n* `Uncertain Future`: It's a sad sound, but not painful. Just a little disappointed in the present life.\n* `Back To Village`: Since she has not been back to the village for a long time, the building just reminds her of the old happy days. To express a strong nostalgia for the past.\n\n## Design Of Music\n`Dream Of The Past` is simple:\n\n* Pads and drones are used to create the overall feeling. A doublebass is added later to make it rich.\n* Harp and warm piano are used for the melody.\n* I had a hard time finding a way to add contract in different sections before introducing the melody in the middle of the track.\n\nDeciding how sad it is becomes the most important part in `Uncertain Future`:\n\n* The very first version consisted of a lot of minor chords and some diminished chords. It was too much. We just went back and forth to find the balance.\n* At the very beginning there are also a lot of bass in the track. It could make it feel heavy, but the designer insisted it's too much. So we took them all out.\n* Later in the track, horns, oboes and cellos are added to make a contract. I tried a lot to make them soft to fit the feeling.\n\nHere is the game designer's reference image: \n\n![Reference Image](/Post004/002.jpg)\n\n`Back To Village` is a short one:\n\n* The third chapter should only be a minute or two long. It shouldn't be more than that.\n* Feeling is the key. There are some Sus4 chords. Just to express the strong nostalgia for the past.\n* Took me a whole day to make.\n\nHere is the game designer's reference image: \n\n![Reference Image](/Post004/003.jpg)\n\n\n## Copyright\nBecause I make music just for fun.

      "## What Are These For\nThese tracks are for the [OST Composing Jam #5](https://itch.io/jam/ost-composing-jam-5). I'm asked to create a series of soundtracks for an imaginary game. To make it clear:\n\n* It's a jam for composers to make game music.\n* But I'm just a composer, I can't make a whole game by myself.\n* Okay, so I could imagine a game with several levels and others.\n* Cool, now I can work on the music.\n\n\n## About The ~~Imaginary~~ Game\n`Faithful Journey` is a game about a girl who starts a hard journey to save her father. Here is the story:\n\n> Once upon a time there was an old fisherman and his daughter. They lived a happy life.\n>\n> But one day, the old fisherman was stung by a deadly poisonous jellyfish. His daughter tried everything, but failed. She cried.\n>\n> Suddenly, a voice appeared and told the girl that there was a fairy at sea. She had to sail there, find the fairy, and bring back the blessing, all before the next morning.\n>\n> Without the slightest hesitation, the brave girl set out to sea. And that's where the story begins.\n\nAnd the game goes like this:\n\n* `Storytelling`: To show the background story so the player has a basic idea of the game.\n* `Day travel`: With a short tutorial, the player starts the journey. To make the game more interesting, there are some rocks on the sea and the player has to avoid them. At the end of the day, some seagulls appear and try to attack the ship. The player must either avoid them or fight them with the harpoon.\n* `Night travel`: After sunset, the voyage becomes even more dangerous. Sometimes a large wave will form ahead. Sometimes a vortex will form around the ship. The player must avoid them all or the ship will be damaged. Later in the game, tentacles will appear and try to destroy the ship.\n* `Game ends`: Finally, the player finds the fairy. After a short cutscene, the fairy sends the player back home and heals the father. The game ends.\n\n\n## About The Tracks\nThere are 6 tracks in total for this game:\n\n| ID  | Usage In Game   | Name In Soundtrack    | Description                          |\n|---- |--------------   |---------------------- |------------------------------------  |\n| 01  | Main Theme      | Journey Started       | Main menu and the storytelling       |\n| 02  | Day Calm        | Peaceful sunny day    | Day travel without the seagulls      |\n| 03  | Day Battle      | White visitors        | Day travel with seagulls around      |\n| 04  | Night Calm      | Moonlight on the sea  | Night travel without tentacles       |\n| 05  | Night Battle    | Slimy tentacles       | Night travel with tentacles around   |\n| 06  | Fairy           | Blessing of faith     | Fairy cutscene                       |\n\nFor all tracks:\n\n* All tracks except the last `Fairy` can be looped. They are looped twice.\n* They are in the fantasy genre. I personally think it fits better with the theme of `faith` and `fairy`.\n* A lot of harps and strings are used. I love the sound of the harp.\n\n\n## Design Of Music\nFor the `Main Theme`:\n\n* At this point, the player should be a little worried about the father's life. The music is a bit depressing and worried. The cello is used to show this.\n* The tension is gradually increased by raising the pitch and adding another set of cello and celesta.\n* I rarely use the celesta because it's too bright. But for fantasy music, well, it fits.\n* The musical form is a simple AB form. I don't think the player will spend too much time on it.\n\nFor the two `day` tracks:\n\n* They have the same tempo and melody. It's simple. I make the day track first, duplicate the project and add some updates to it.\n* Well, by **some** updates I mean replacing most of the instruments, adding a drum kit, and replacing soft keyboards like ambient piano and marimba with strings. This is actually a big change.\n\nThe `Day Calm` one is simple:\n\n* I want it to be positive, relaxing, and bright. Yes, the father is still sick, but everything looks fine by far. It should be relaxing.\n* To make it relaxing, the tempo is only 92 BPM and the instruments are high attack and high release. To make it ambient.\n* I like to combine a keyboard and a string. It makes the sound lush and rich. In this track it's an ambient piano and violins.\n\nThe `Day Battle` one, well:\n\n* All instruments are replaced to fit the battle theme.\n* Ambient keyboard instruments are replaced with trumpets and hard.\n* Broken chords will use 16th notes. I cannot change the tempo, this is the only way.\n\nThe `night` music should be more relaxing than the daytime music:\n\n* It's slower than the day tracks. The BPM drops from 92 to 70.\n* Choose instruments that are more \"warm\" than \"bright\".\n\nThe `Night Calm` track is quite simple:\n\n* The whole music consists of three parts: some long notes as melody, chords to make it feel relaxing, and broken chords to give it some energy.\n* Some woodwinds are used for the melody. It makes the music warm and calm.\n* A big pad and some strings handle the chord. I need them to make it rich and balanced.\n* For the broken chords, again, marimba and harp.\n* The harp is ideal for the dream and fantasy feeling.\n\nFor the `Night Battle`:\n\n* Again, strings replace the keys. Woodwinds are taken and brass are added. With a drum kit. It feels like a piece of battle music now.\n* I try to use a pair of instruments for each section. One on the left channel and one on the right. It's a bit tricky to balance the volume between the two channels, but it feels great.\n* It feels more like a march than ambient music. Anyway, I can feel the danger of the tentacles, I think.\n\nThe last track is the `Fairy`.\n\n* There is nothing (for the player) to do now. Just watch the cutscene, the little girl will meet the fairy, pray to her, be teleported back home and the father will be healed.\n* The music is split into two parts, before the teleportation and after.\n* Before the teleportation, it's a bit deep, mysterious and uncertain. The girl is still not sure if this is the fairy she's looking for.\n* Then comes a riser and a gap. In the game, this could be a white flash. Then the girl (along with the boat) and the fairy are back home.\n* After that, there are four steps\n   * The fairy heals the father\n   * The father gets up from bed\n   * Both the father and the girl thank the fairy.\n   * The game ends.\n* Each of the four steps is accompanied by a broken chord. The music gets higher and higher until the very end of the game.\n* Since the music ends with a \"Game End\" scene, there is no need to loop it.\n\n\n## Copyright\nBecause I make music just for fun.

      "## About The Game\nThese tracks are for an indie FPS game. The game takes place on a spaceship where the player is surrounded by high-tech items and some deadly crazy machines that are trying to kill the player. The player is encouraged to kill these machine enemies and survive as long as possible.\n\nHere is the description from the designer himself:\n\n> The story is, the world has been taken over by robots as Mr. Robert's son, Benny, tried to reprogram a robot to destroy his homework when he was following his dad for work in E.P.I.C. Robot Laboratory(standing for Engineered Prototype Inventive Creations). But since Benny had little knowledge of programming, he accidentally made the robot try to destroy the human race instead of doing his homework!\n\n## Music Required\nAfter discussion, we believe 4 types of music are needed:\n\n* Main Menu: It should be upbeat and happy, but calm. The battle has not yet begun.\n* Low levels: It's typical battle music. But in a future tech theme. \n* High levels: It should use the same rhythm and melody as the low level. But more hot-blooded.\n* Boss Fight: It should be a piece of energetic, hot-blooded battle music. But still in the future tech theme.\n\n\n## Design Of Music\nThe first music we worked on was the 'high levels' music.\n\n* A lot of leads are used in the music for that \"future tech\" feeling.\n* It's battle music and we can't emphasize the melody. Instead, several broken chords are used throughout the music.\n* A violin part is introduced in the middle of the music. Just to add some variation.\n\nBy making the `high levels` music a bit quieter, we got the `low levels` music.\n\n* The tempo is still the same because that's what the designer wanted.\n* Instruments are replaced so it's different.\n   * Drums are changed to a studio drum set \n   * Dirty leads are replaced with piano, bright metallic lead and violin.\n* I love the beautiful sound of the violin.\n\nThe next one is the boss fight:\n\n* Well, it's a typical boss fight. Should be stressful and dangerous.\n* It starts with three \"warnings\". So the developers don't have to add the SFX later. Of course, the warning is in the `intro` part of the music, it will not be looped later.\n* Fast broken chords are used throughout the music. To add some tension.\n* Due to the game design, the fight won't last long. Usually 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nThe last is the main menu:\n\n* It should be upbeat, bright music. But the scene in the game is in dark color with even a lot of purple color. \n* Because the color purple is usually associated with an \"unpleasant\" feeling. This music is a bit dark. This is achieved by adding some diminished triads in the chord.\n* To match the dark background, a lot of reverb is added to several instruments. Make it quieter.\n\n\n## Copyright\nBecause I make music just for fun. Whoever comes here is free to use my music in their project as long as they give me credit.",

      "## About The Game\nThe theme of this jam is `Roll Of The Dice`. Our team has created a game that consists of 6 mini-games. Each time the dice are rolled, the player is taken to a different game, including: \n\n* `Serve`: Serve the right food to the right customer, but do it quickly or they will get angry!\n* `Avoid`: The goal is simple - avoid the bullets.\n* `Jump`: Jump over the obstacles and try not to die.\n* `Count`: Match the number on the screen with the number of dots on the dice before time runs out.\n* `Care`: Keep Dicey alive by feeding him at the right intervals. Don't feed him too little - he'll starve to death, but don't feed him too much either.\n* `Chill`: Take a breather. Maybe pet your cat. Have a sip of tea. This break will not last long, so enjoy it while it lasts.\n\nHere is the [link to the game](https://basswastaken.itch.io/gamejam-2022-entry)\n\n## Music Required\nSince it consists of 6 mini-games, we decide to make 6 pieces of music. One for each. Also\n\n* We will make all six pieces of music have the same melody and tempo. This way, we can switch between the different games, but the music will still be the same.\n* However, since the 6 mini-games are different in design, the music should fit each mini-game.\n\nWell, making 6 pieces of music in two days (GMTK 2022 is a 48-hour jam) is not easy. Fortunately, we will not make 6 different pieces of music, but 1 piece of music and 5 variations.\n\n\n## Design Of Music\nThe first music I work on is `Serve`:\n\n* Making the melody and harmony is nothing special.\n* It's a basic binary form of music. I try to balance the music in two parts.\n* Choosing the tempo is a **BIG** headache. It has to fit all the music (so they are the same length and can switch freely).\n* It's usually done in the afternoon of the first day.\n\n`Avoid` is the second one:\n\n* It's the most challenging of the six. The player can (or should) be pushed a bit.\n* The music should be exciting, but not too exciting.\n* A few more beats are added to make it hot-blooded.\n* Another pad is added to make it thicker.\n\nThe third one is the `Care`:\n\n* It should be relatively relaxing.\n* As a comparison. Piano and violin are added to make it lush and beautiful (I love the combination of piano and violin).\n* The strings make it feel a bit slow and calm.\n* Also the drums are changed to a weaker one.\n* We tried to use a `meow` sound for the melody. It does not work.\n\n`Chill` is designed for the player to relax:\n\n* It should be an ambient one.\n* But, sorry, I cannot change the tempo. I try to make it as cool as I can.\n* Big reverb is used. No, a big reveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerb is used in the music. It feels good.\n\n`Jump` comes next:\n\n* This is as challenging as the `Avoid`. I'm encouraged to make it overwhelming.\n* A new drum kit is used. To add some power and a punchy feel.\n* Personally, the kick fits well into the music, like a footstep sound.\n\nThe last one, `Count`:\n\n* This should be in between the 'Care' and 'Serve'. Not as quiet as petting the cat, but not as stressful as working in a restaurant.\n* Trumpet and saxophone are used to add a jazz touch.\n* Drum beats are rearranged.\n* This is the last minute of the second day. I'm in a hurry. I'm not sure it's balanced.\n\n\n## Copyright\nBecause I make music just for fun. Whoever comes here is free to use my music in their project as long as they give me credit.",
